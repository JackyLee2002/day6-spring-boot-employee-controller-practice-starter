O:I learned more about Spring Framework (particuarly Spring Boot) and its clear opinionated concepts, like Inversion of Control (IoC) and dependency injection (DI). Spring framworks offer a wide variety of tools and projects to support an extensive usecases. Some of the most commonly used tools, like Spring Data JPA, Spring Security and Spring Cloud can be easily integrated and adopted using tools like Spring Initializr to start a Spring Boot starter application. I also learnt to mock and test MVC APIs in Spring Boot.

R: Amicible

I: Having used Spring Boot for both work and personal projects, Spring Boot and some of its starter projects like Security and JPA are quite familiar and amicible. Spring Boot reduced the configuration time drastically through auto-configuration and adoption of specific annotations to add these functions. I also learnt more in depth about the core features and the principal about these Spring framework projects.

D: I plan to be more familiar with Spring framework and its different projects, in which some I have never used before, like Session, to expand my knowledge in the framework to support a larger variety of usecases/
